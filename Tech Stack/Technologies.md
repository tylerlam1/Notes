# Python
Python is a easy-to-learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple yet effective approach to object-oriented programming. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++. 

Python is an interpreted language, which means no compilation and linking is necessary. Statement grouping is done by indentation rather than brackets. No variable or argument declarations are necessary.

Python is extensible: If you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, like linking Python programs to libraries that may be only available in binary form. 

## Interpreter
You can exit the interpreter by pressing `quit()`.
