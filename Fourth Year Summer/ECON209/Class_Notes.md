# ECON 209

## Lecture 1

Knowing about the money aspect of things are very important. Sometimes its up to the engineer to determine the costs of things.

Our instructor has background in engineering sales and learned quite a bit about the money aspect in engineering. He's also had experience with consulting and project evaluations.

In this class, we look at different economic concepts for the first couple of weeks. Next, we focus on practical problems like whether a company should invest in a project. We look at inflation, taxes. etc. The first couple weeks will be similar to ECON201/203.

We don't need the textbook for the first couple of weeks. If you do though, he recommends _Macro-Economics_ text. The official textbook for the course is _Contemporary Engineering Economics_. We don't need the textbook if we don't want it.

First Quiz has been moved to Monday July 12th. Midterm is July 21st. Second quix is August 4th. On the quiz, usually not more than 20 questions. Probably around 20 minutes for that.

The best way to prepare for the quizzes is coming to lectures, working through worksheets, and going to the tutorials.

The tutorials starts next week. In the tutorial, the TAs will go through the questions. The tutorial answer key will not be added to D2L (but the questions will be on D2L). This is incentive to go to the tutorials. The tutorial themselves are not recorded.

The Department of Economics added a curving scale. Also there's room to push weight to the final if you do better on the final than on the midterm.

Now we'll get into the actual material.

Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated among alternative uses to satisfy human wants and needs. It's a study of choice. An economy is a set of interrelated consumption and production activities to maintain a standard of living.

- Resources: Land (minerals, timber, metals, etc), labour (intelligence and human work, called sweat equality), and capital (goods used to make other goods, uses resources to build a building).
- Scarcity: There is not enough goods and services to meet everyone's needs and desires.
- Opportunity cost: What is given up when a choice or decision is made, including the most valued alternative

There are three key economic ideas:

- People are rational. We have the ability to reason, and gather all relevant information. They should be able to determine if the marginal benefit outweighs the marginal cost.
- People Respond to Incentives. This could include money, food, finding a mate, or protecting their young.
- People make decisions on the margin.

Here are examples of irrational behavior:

- Measuring costs and benefits as proportions rather than absolute value (i.e. Thinking that $25 off on a $1000 item is worth less than $25 off a $100 item)
- Failure to ignore sunk costs (You should ignore money you've already lost)
- Paying too much tax in order to get a big tax return. i.e. Thinking that winnings in a Casino are worth less than "normal" money
- People are prone to mental accounting (spending your money recklessly after winning a lottery)
- Jumping into a stock market because a neighbour recommended a stock

Key Economic Question a society faces:

1. What goods and services will be produced by society? Think about what people want.
2. How will the goods and services be produced?
3. Who will receive the goods and services produced?

Market Failure - when the society fail to provide these services (like health care, firefighters) so the government provides them.

The solution to the three economic problems described above depends on the economic system. For example, a right wing economy would have more privatized businesses. The left wing economies have more government-centralized services.

Karl Marx is the founder of communism (command economy). He felt that capitalism cause unemployments (from the depressions). There were no "social nets" that creates huge amounts of unemployments.

Adam Smith wrote _The Wealth of Nations_ in 1776 that talked about capitalism and the free market. The idea is that the government would not interfere in the market. He said an "Invisible Hand" would guide the demand and production in the market. He said that for a free market system to work, you need to have a property rights system and a court system to enforce it (ie. Someone to ensure that you own something).

## Lecture 2

Today we're going to talk about economic models, micro/macro economics, GDP, business cycles, as well as inflation. First couple minutes the instructor gave a brief overview of the previous lecture.

In terms of the textbook, we're skipping a couple lectures. We skipped chapters 2 and 3, and going straight from chapter 1 to chapter 4. The quiz has 24 hour access for all students in the class.

- Economic Model - Tries to predict human behavior. We try to develop a model to predict when something changes. The most important model in microeconomics is supply/demand. Supply and demand is a human behaviour model because it tries to predict human behavior.
- Scientific Method - Includes testable hypothesis. This is a casuable observation of the real world. For example, we can hypothesize that the demand for video games increases when the price goes down. Gather the data to prove it, and analyze the data. Once the data has been analyzed, we can either reject or prove our hypothesis. In economics, its a bit more difficult to get data. We have to observe human behaviour, which is a bit harder.
