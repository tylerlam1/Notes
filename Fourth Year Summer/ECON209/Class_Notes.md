# ECON 209
## Lecture 1
Knowing about the money aspect of things are very important. Sometimes its up to the engineer to determine the costs of things.

Our instructor has background in engineering sales and learned quite a bit about the money aspect in engineering. He's also had experience with consulting and project evaluations.

In this class, we look at different economic concepts for the first couple of weeks. Next, we focus on practical problems like whether a company should invest in a project. We look at inflation, taxes. etc. The first couple weeks will be similar to ECON201/203.

We don't need the textbook for the first couple of weeks. If you do though, he recommends *Macro-Economics* text. The official textbook for the course is *Contemporary Engineering Economics*. We don't need the textbook if we don't want it.

First Quiz has been moved to Monday July 12th. Midterm is July 21st. Second quix is August 4th. On the quiz, usually not more than 20 questions. Probably around 20 minutes for that.

The best way to prepare for the quizzes is coming to lectures, working through worksheets, and going to the tutorials.

The tutorials starts next week. In the tutorial, the TAs will go through the questions.  The tutorial answer key will not be added to D2L (but the questions will be on D2L). This is incentive to go to the tutorials. The tutorial themselves are not recorded.

The Department of Economics added a curving scale. Also there's room to push weight to the final if you do better on the final than on the midterm.

Now we'll get into the actual material.

Economics is the study of how scarce resources are allocated among alternative uses to satisfy human wants and needs. It's a study of choice. An economy is a set of interrelated consumption and production activities to maintain a standard of living.

- Resources: Land (minerals, timber, metals, etc), labour (intelligence and human work, called sweat equality), and capital (goods used to make other goods, uses resources to build a building).
- Scarcity: There is not enough goods and services to meet everyone's needs and desires.
- Opportunity cost: What is given up when a choice or decision is made, including the most valued alternative

There are three key economic ideas:
- People are rational. We have the ability to reason, and gather all relevant information. They should be able to determine if the marginal benefit outweighs the marginal cost.
- People Respond to Incentives. This could include money, food, finding a mate, or protecting their young.
- People make decisions on the margin.
