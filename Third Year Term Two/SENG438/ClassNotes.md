# Software Testing

The goal of this class is to understand software testing and reliability engineering processes. You also want to design test cases and improve test suites, and assess reliability and quality of software.

In this class, it's important to mix theory and practice together. Theory/Research/Concepts are focused on during lectures and exams. Labs and projects will be emphasized in labs and projects.

## What affects Software Quality?

A couple factors affect software quality.
* Time - Meeting the project deadline, or reaching the market at the right time
* Cost - Meeting the anticipated project costs
* Quality - Working fine for the designated period on the designated system

Let's look at some terminology.

The dependability of a system is the ability to avoid failures that are more frequent or more severe, and outage durations that are longer, than is acceptable to users.

The dependability is dependent on the threats, attributes (availability, reliability), means, and models.

## Software Testing

Software Testing can be exploratory testing, white-box, black-box, regression testing. 

To calculate Reliability = exp(-xt)

x = failure rate/ failure density
t = time

x = 1/(Mean time to failure)

## Software Reliability

Software Reliability involves the Reliability, Availability, Failure Rate, MTTF,Failure Density.

## Software Quality

Software Quality involves size and effort (predict size, predict effort, predict time).

## Service

A service delivered by a system is its behaviour as its perceived ny its users. A user is another system that interacts with the former at the service interface.

The function of a system is what the system is intended to do, and is described by the functional specification.

## Dependability: Threats

An error is a human action that results in software containing a fault.
A fault is a cause for either a failure of the program or an internal error.

A failure is an event that occurs when the delivered service deviates from the correct service.

The failure intensity is the number of failures per natural or time unit.

When considering testing vs inspection:
* Inspections are strict and close examinations conducted on specifications, design, code, test and other artifacts.

You can start inspections early in the life cycle.

* Testing on the other hand, allows for defect detection and starts later in the lifecycle.

Inspection cannot replace testing. Inspections can only replace testing if all information gleaned through testing could be obtained through inspection.

## Errors

When considering errors, there are two meanings:
* A discrepancy between a computed, observed or measured value and the true, specified, or theoretically correct value

* Human errors are hardest to detect

## Dependability: Attributes

* Availability: readiness for correct service
* reliability: continuity for correct service
* safety: absence of catastrophic consequences on the users and the environment
* confidentiality: absence of unauthorized disclosure of information
* Integrity: absence of improper system state alterations
* Maintainability: ability to undergo repairs and modifications
