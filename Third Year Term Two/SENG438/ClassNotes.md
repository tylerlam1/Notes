# Software Testing

The goal of this class is to understand software testing and reliability engineering processes. You also want to design test cases and improve test suites, and assess reliability and quality of software.

In this class, it's important to mix theory and practice together. Theory/Research/Concepts are focused on during lectures and exams. Labs and projects will be emphasized in labs and projects.

## What affects Software Quality?

A couple factors affect software quality.
* Time - Meeting the project deadline, or reaching the market at the right time
* Cost - Meeting the anticipated project costs
* Quality - Working fine for the designated period on the designated system

Let's look at some terminology.

The dependability of a system is the ability to avoid failures that are more frequent or more severe, and outage durations that are longer, than is acceptable to users.

The dependability is dependent on the threats, attributes (availability, reliability), means, and models.

## Software Testing

Software Testing can be exploratory testing, white-box, black-box, regression testing. 

To calculate Reliability = exp(-xt)

x = failure rate/ failure density
t = time

x = 1/(Mean time to failure)

## Software Reliability

Software Reliability involves the Reliability, Availability, Failure Rate, MTTF,Failure Density.

## Software Quality

Software Quality involves size and effort (predict size, predict effort, predict time).
