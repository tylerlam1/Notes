The following are some factors that may have influenced impact/adoption:
* Clinical trials
* Regulatory Approvals
* Technology adoption
* Time
* Technological developments
* Animal Testing
* Money
* Patient involvement
* Physician involvement

We can break down the biodesign process into the following steps:
1. Needs finding
2. Needs screening
3. Concept finding
4. Concept screening
5. Strategy Development
6. Business planning

It's important that the need should drive the innovation. The right need will produce the best solution. Not all needs are made equal, and iteration is a part of the process. Take your time and ensure that you don't get solutions too early.

Iteration and cycling is a key part of the invention process process. Implementation is just the beginning, and you need to evaluate and acknowledge the risks. Keep an eye on the value. 

Your strategic focus should talk about the following:
* Your team priorities/mission
* Opportunity: What can be leveraged
* Other factors: What else can influence choices

Your missing statement should have your purpose, scope and customer. It's a brief statement that is no longer than 3 sentences.

When starting to figure out a problem, you can consider the following:
* Personal or family experience
* Professional experience
* Literature review
* Clinical information

Steps associated with needs finding:
1. Background research
2. Obtain access to observation/interview opportunities
3. Prepare for your observation/interview
4. take notes, drawings, pictures
5. Post-explore and summarize

When completing background research, consider the following:
* Disease State Fundamentals - Find out information about the disease (what is the problem, who is affected, and what is the ideal outcome)
* Existing Solutions - Find out information about existing solutions (what are the current solutions)
* Stakeholder Analysis - Find out information about important stakeholders in play (who is involved in the treatment)
* Market Analysis - Find out important information about the current state of the market (what is the patient view on the problem)

When conducting observations and interviews:
* Jut observe and engage. do not judge
* Be curious and don't be shy
* Find patterns
* Be aware of ethical implications

* Ask WHY
* Don't be saying USUALLY
* DIG into details
* SILENCE may be needed for reflection
* no BINARY questions

When creating a needs statement:
You need the:
* Problem
* Population
* Outcome

A way to address "problem" in "population" so "outcome".

Some terminology:
* Epidemiology: The cause, distribution, and control of disease
* Anatomy and physiology: the body organs and their functions
* Pathophysiology: Effect on normal function
* Clinical presentation: The symptoms and signs available
* Clinical outcomes: Effects of disease
* Economic impact: Cost

Gap analysis involves finding the gaps between the existing solutions and the desired solution. This is done in the categories of outcomes, population, and value.

Market segmentation is the subgroups in the market to which the new device may be addressed. You can segment the market by patient population, by provider, or by payer. This is part of the market analysis, where you analyze disease spending, costs and SWOT for competing solutions (Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats).

A Need Specification is a detailed and standalone document that describes the need in detail.

When generating ideas, it's important to differentiate between an idea and a concept. 

An idea may be only clear to you and your team, and it becomes a concept when it is understood by others.

You need to validate your idea. Validate it against determined criteria:
* Need (does it respond to the need value?)
* Value (does it give the desired value?)
* Acceptance/strategic focus (is this within the team's focus?)

When generating concepts:
* Draft drawing
* Short description
* Bullet points of features
* Picture of physical construct from the brainstorming

In order for something to be patentable, it must be:
* Useful
* Novel
* Not obvious

Therefore, the invention must be something people can use, must be not something already invented, and something not obvious to skilled individuals. It should describe the invention in a clear and reproducible way. In addition, should be an idea that has been reduced to practice.

A FTO is the commercial production, marketing and use of a new concept that does not infringe on the IP rights of others. As long as an existing patent is not more general, then it is okay. 

The following are some patent types:
* Provisional - initial application before full utility patent is filed (USA). Canada does not have this type but allows for internal priority over a previous filing.
* Utility - full patent application usually allowing for small amendments over provisional
* PCT - patent cooperation treaty application, it provides with priority and search results at an international level. It does not provide international patents though.
* European - single application for all european countries, it provides with priority and search at European level.

Ownership terms:
* Inventor - person who conceived the invention, once determined it is not changed
* Inventorship - complete list of inventors that contributed to the concept; errors in inventoryship can invalidate a patent
* asignee(s) - entity that has the property right to the patent; the inventor and the assignee may be one in the same but employee will likely assign to the company
* licensee - person with permission to use patent while asignee retains ownership

IP more than just patent. An IP portfolio is the intellectual capital of the venture. It is continously developed from concept generation. It protects invention, manages competition, allows freedom in design, builds markets, provides revenue, drives business.

When developing your IP portfolio, think offensively and defensively:
* defensive: think of ways a competitor may circumvent the the patent. 
* offensive: patents and claims designed to stop competitors from creating new

The FDA regulates medical devices.
* It's divided into centers according to the product type: drug, biologics, devices and diagnostic technologies
* The office of device evaluation (ODE) is subsequently divided according to branch (discipline)
* Classification (1, 2 and 3) establshes risk of the device

Class I: Minimal potential harm and simple design
Class II: Non-invasive but more complicated
Class III: Implantable, therapeutic, life-sustaining

Canada has different Regulatory pathways.

Class II:
* Identify device and manufacturer
* Description of the device, purposes, and uses
* List of the standards complied with

Class III: 
* Materials used in manufacture and packaging
* List of the countries other than Canada where it has been sold and any reported problems and recalls
* Summary of all studies on which the manufacturer relies
* A bibliography of all published reports

Class IV:
* Risk assessment
* MAnufacturing process
* Pre-clinical and clinical studies

In FDA, 

Class I is considered Exempt. You just need to:
* Register product
* Comply with FDA label/quality systems

Class II is considered cleared. You need to:
* Compare this product to predicate(s)
* Data from bench, animal, and clinical tests
* Indications
* Sample advertisement

Class III is considred Approved. You need to:
* Collect safety and effectiveness data
* Clinical studies for effectiveness
* Section on technical data: biocompatiblity, pre-clinical and biological testing
* Investigational device brochure

Europe has a uniform CE marking system accepted in the Union.
* It requires clinical data proving safety and performance
* All clinical trials must folloe ISO 14155
* Preferably the manufacturer should comply with ISO 14385
* Typically handled by third parties acting in behalf of the Authority
* Data collected can be used for Health Canada but it will only be taken as preliminary data for the FDA.

## Miscellaneous

Here is the list of acceptance criteria of your mission statement/strategic focus:
* Market dynamics and competition
* Project fit with innovators mission and capabilities
* Anticipated market growth
* Effect on improving health outcomes
* Effect of affordability/accessibility of care
* Time/resources required to achieve results
* Customers that need to be cultivated
* Revenue/size market 

The target market is the market segment that stands to gain the most value from a new solution.

The following are key factors that can be used to divide the total market of all potential customers into distinct segments:
1. size and growth
2. competitive dynamics
3. needs 
4. willingness to pay

The market landscape:
* analyse the rough spending on the disease
* analyse the cost of current solutions
* analyse SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) around current solutions
* is there a cost gap?
* Proter's five forces for a new solution

HMW stands for "How might we..." and helps kickoff the brainstorming process by turning questions into ideation.

Reduction to practice means the idea is being diligently pursued and there is credible prototype or reuslts.
