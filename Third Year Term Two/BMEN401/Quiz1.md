It's important to define a meaningful mission statement. Let's look at an example.

Medtronic was a company founded in 1949 by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law Palmer as a medical equipment repair shop. It quickly expanded its services to encompass device design, decelopment, and manufacturering equipment work.

Medtronic received positive and inspiring feedback from patients. From this inspiring feedback, Medtronic expanded to include Medtronic Mission, which remains a huge part of the company's culture and the driving force behind every project it undertakes. This mission guides the company's daily work and keeps the employees focused on the goal:

Their mission is:

* To *contribute to human welfare* by application of biomedical engineering in research, design, manufacture, and sale of instruments or appliances that alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life
* To *direct growth in the areas of biomedical engineering where we display maximum strength and ability*; to gather people and facilities that tend to augment these areas; to continously build on these areas through education and knowledge assimilation; to avoid participation in areas where we cannot make unique and worthy contributions.
* Strive without reserver for greatest reliability and quality in our products
* Make a fair profit
* Recognize the personal worth of employees
* Maintain good citizenship

As you can see, their mission statement does well to define their purpose, scope of operations, and defines who their target audience is. Before the development of any solution can take place, innovators must first identify and understand the opportunities that are associated with their chosen strategic focus. Doing this requires doing background research, first-hand observations, and interviews. 

Let's first focus on *identifying* the problem.

When identifying the problem, we need to be first finding the needs. Needs exploration is all about understanding various elements of a problem that a new technology may be able to address.

We need to consider three dimensions.

1. The core problem - the basic issue that is limiting the quality and/or affordability of care in the healthcare industry. There also may be problems that are less easier to brainstorm and require a different healthcare setting to observe.
2. The population - determining the relevant population affected by the problem.
3. The desired outcome - positive change or improved end result that would be experienced by the population with your solution

As mentioned before, the three most common techniques to perform needs exploration is through:
1. background research
2. observations
3. interviews

Let's delve deeper into each category.

## Background Research
It is necessary to do background research to prepare detailed first-hand information in their area of interest. The background research needs to be deep.

For example, you'll want to know the disease state, existing solutions, stakeholders, and market factors. Primed with this knowledge, innovators can use this information to prepare for future interviews (as questions). It is important to recognize all the different perspectives.

Research can help innovators discover any 'disconnects' among stakeholders. 

When interviewing, it's also important on how you phrase your question as it can easily bias an answer.

## Observations

It's important to directly observe a situation if you really want a clinical problem to come to life. Often times, an observation centers on a singular event that the innovator witnesses. In order to quantify something into a real problem, the issue should bring up recurring situations in which problems are encountered. Below is an example.

*Observation:* A medical resident in training sturggles to intubate a patient in the emergency room, leading to a drop in the patients oxygen level.
*Problem:* Difficulty placing the endotracheal breathing tube into an emergency setting.
*Population:* Untrained/unskilled practitioners.
*Outcome:* Ability to place an endotracheal tube in timely manner without dangerous drop in oxygen saturation.

When setting up observations, it may be difficulty to gain access to appropriate clinical settings to perform the observation. Therefore, many medtech inventions directly come from the physician. 

There's a couple ways to gain access:
* Leverage personal connections
* Partner with a physician or professional to address issue
* Cold-Call

When observing, it's important to witness the entire procedure. If you're viewing only a small portion of the procedure, you're likely to miss something. Also, you should witness the preparation procedure in addition to the main operation. This includes locations where follow-up care and preliminary measurements are taken.

When conducting an observation, the process links itself to something called *ethnographic research*. The basic ethnographic method involves the researchers becoming immersed in the activities of the people they want to study with the goal of gaining an in-depth perspective on how they think and feel. It's important to gain an good understanding of the group being studied.

Empathy is a big part of ethnographic research. This involves coming up with creative ways to "get inside somones head". This could include inducing a disability (on purpose). It's also a good idea to be humble and be open to listening and learning. 

It's important to:

* not judge
* be curious
* question everything
* find patterns
* listen

It's also important to advise that an observer should always try to "be a part of the team". As opposed to isolating oneself from the rest, they should try to get to know the team members, and learn from them.

The observer effect is when practitioners/patients act differently in the prescence of a observer.

It's important to also perform several trials of observations. Different locations/settings could present different methods of performing an operation. 

When documenting observations, innovators can use an innovation notebook to capture their observations. This documentation may prove useful in the future when they seek to protect their work. Earlier documentation may capture more accurate and detailed observations. When observing, it's important to only document what is seen. 

There are always guidelines regarding observations, and observers must keep patient info confidential as instructed. The observer must also gauge where it is most appropriate to ask questions or simply observe.

## Interviews

Once the observations have been conducted, innovators can start asking questions. Questions should be thought-provoking and memorable. For example, you can ask what stood out the most, biggest problems, etc. Different team members may have different insights. It's important to capture each headline, quote, surprise or interesting bit of information. Therefore, the innovator can determine what should be pursued n the future. 

There should be no bias associated with the opinion of one team member over another. 

Things to keep in mind during interviews:
* Why?
* Avoid "usually"
* Encourage stories
* Look for inconsistencies
* Do not be afraid of silence
* Don't suggest answers
* Be prepared to write

## Value exploration

One of the most important factors associated with device development is maximizing economic value. This starts during needs exploration. During any observation, innovators should always be looking out for inefficiencies, or other undue costs that can be eliminated.
