# Biomedical Engineering Design

We are surrounded by biomedical devices everywhere. For example, a thermometer, respiract, IV Pole, are all examples of devices being used around us.

Why do some devices take so long to create? What dictates the speed of a product coming to market?
* Clinical Trials
* Regulatory Approvals
* Animal Testing 
* Level of Technology - Is the level of technology good enough for the necessary development
* Lack of research (is the field well explored?)
* Patient involvement (is the patient too late?)

## BIODESIGN

There is a process of innovating medical technologies.

1. Finding needs - What problem are you trying to solve?
2. You need to screen the findings - Is this problem solvable?
3. Concept generation - Generate a solution
4. Concept screening - Is this solution worthy?
5. Strategy development - Develop a strategy to develop the solution
6. Business planning - Plan the logistics associated with the sales of the solution

We can break these steps into three major parts. 

First, we need to Identify. We need to find and screen needs.

* The need must drive innovation, not the product
* Finding the right need will produce a better solution
* Screening needs require analysis of the value
* Iteration is a part of the process
* Not all needs are equal
* Take your time!

The second step is to Invent.

* The need should guide the invention
* Iteration and cycling is important
* Not all solutions are equal

The final step is Implement.

* Just the beginning
* Evaluate and acknowledge risks
* Keep an eye on value
* Commercialization is the path to reach patients
* Selling your solution is critical


Before you begin solving your problem, you should evaluate:
* Team preferences
* interest area
* personal passion
* team strengths and weaknesses
* economic environment
* research experience/data
* access to population
* market opportunity

It's important to have a strategic focus when building a solution. There are several components of the strategic focus:

* Mission Statement - Purpose, scope of operations, customer
* Motivation behind biodesign innovation process
* Factors that influence biomedical device impact
* Elements that determine strategic focus

## Needs Statement

A way to identify internal view of the organs in cancer patients that would help medical professionals find better ways to fight cancer.

pitfalls:
why internal only, cancer only?

New statement: A way to identify internal view of the organs in patients with internal disorders that would help medical professionals find ways to combat illnesses.

## Concept Generation
### Class Activity
1. Team 5
2. WE have 4 members
3. Electrical, mechanical, software
4. Nope

Ideas:
* Facilitator is Sophia
* Wheelchair that has mechanism to raise seat up - Lock the wheel chair and it can go up and down
    * Mechanically powered
    * Voice activation
    * Something they can use their feet for
* Make a chute to slide things down
* Conveyer belt to lift things up
* Lower-body exoskeleton
* Mechanical arms - With a camera so you can see what you're doing
    * Building on that - something like a drone?
* Inflatable wheels - they can lift you up
* Airport Tray that grabs the item - uses friction
* Plunger suction - open doors and grab the item
* A clamp arm  - can detect a arm handle
    * Balloon powered type of door handler opener
* When placing things inside a cabinet, something that can encase delicate items before they are placed would be useful
* A clamp similar to what works for the blue chart/recycling bin, etc.
* Hydraulic Power
* Wheels on the table
* Movable shelves
* Carousel up and down

## Regulations

* Health Canada regulates food/drugs in Canada
* FDA regulates the USA

There are different classification rules, including determining the Class, Nature, Rules, etc. Determine whether the device is invasive/non-invasive, active/inactive.

Definitions:
* Invasive - Come into contact within the surface of eye, or penetrate the body, either through body orifice or through the body surface
* Non-Invasive - By exclusion
* Active - Operates on a source of energy rather than human body/gravity
