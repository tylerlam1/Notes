# Software Requirements Engineering

There are five components of software engineering. They are listed below.

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Developing
4. Testing
5. Maintaining/Deploying

When discussing the requirements of a system, you should be able to identify the:
* Desired capacities of the system
* Assumptions
* Constraints 
* Conditions

Requirements Engineering is a set of activities to identify and communicate the purpose of a software system and the contexts of which it will be used. Hence. RE acts as a bridge between the real world needs of the stakeholders affected by the software and the capabilities and opportunities afforded by software intensive technologies.

A reuqirement is a *condition* or *capability* that must be met by the system to solve a problem or achieve an objective.

There are four types of requirements:
* Enterprise Requirements
    * Sets the constraints/conditions (WHY)
* Functional Requirements
    * Features (WHAT)
* Non-Functional requirements
    * Constraints (HOW)
* Client/User Requirements
    * Constraints (WHO)

Requirements can also be divided in the WRPSM model. 

When writing requirements, try to have the following words: shall, should, must, have to, need to.

The WRSPM Model stands for Work, Requirements, Specifications, Program, and Machine.

In App Domain, you have Domain Properties - These are things you cannot change... your system must fulfill these. You also have Requirements, which are things you must fulfill to be able to do what's intended to do (to make client happy).

In Machine Domain, you have computers and programs and computers. 

The overlap of these two are the specifications, whih is behaviours that your system should be able to do (how the requirements are fulfilled).

What's the difference between verification vs validation?

Verification is done to ensure software meets specifications (verify it does what you want).
Validation is to check if the software covers everything (everything in the application domain)
